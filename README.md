# CryptoClustering
CryptoClustering is a Python project that uses unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, to predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The project involves data analysis, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and visualization of clustering results.
